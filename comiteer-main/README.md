Comiteer allows students to discover nearby volunteering opportunities that interest them and then connects them with the organisers through a safe messaging platform.




Every year, a growing number of students are required to participate in volunteering activities in the community. 

our research shows that this potential is not being utilized for the community.

85% of these students want to make a meaningful difference with their volunteering. However, only 22% of students feel that their current volunteering is worthwhile

For service learning to meet it’s true potential, we need to close this massive gap. Doing so would help us enable an increased amount of effective sharing of time, resources, services and skills within the community.

So, how do we close this gap? 92% of these students identified finding volunteer opportunities as the key issue holding them back. 

Common secondary issues identified include: contacting non profit organizations and finding opportunities near where they live. 

At the same time, despite an increase in students looking to volunteer, 80% of non profit organizations report that they have not observed an increase in students getting involved with their volunteer programs.

Comiteer brings together nonprofit organizations and students, to share their time, resources, services and skills to enable meaningful change in our community. Our solution allows students to discover nearby volunteering opportunities that interest them and then connects them with the organisers through a safe messaging platform.

We set out to make Comiteer easy and safe with the broader goal of establishing a thriving, sustainable community. We believe the best way to achieve a sustainable community is through targeting the youth as they are

1. Full of energy and passion that a community needs to thrive, our surveys have shown that the youth have the commitment and belief required for service, with  85% of these students wanting to make a meaningful difference with their volunteering.
2. They are a large and growing demographic, more and more schools are expanding into service learning, 50% of our surveyed students stated that service learning had only come into their schools in the past five years. This gives us the numbers for a thriving and vibrant community.
3. Lastly, these youth are shaping what their future lives will be and by providing positive service experiences we can set up a lifelong passion for service. This lifelong passion keeps our community sustainable.


 we start at the map which is at the center of the Comiteer experience. Here we are in my local area, let’s take a look around for let’s say an education volunteering opportunity. We can filter out these results for education related opportunities. We can message back and forth, and arrange a time for me to get involved.

 key focuses of this prototype: discoverability and safety.

Discoverability all focuses around the map and three themes: localisation, visual markers and speed.


This focus on the discoverability process is the reason why 89% of our target market found the platform easy to use when testing it.

As I alluded to earlier, security and safety is critical for our users. We take a three prong approach to safety: protect, educate and act.

Let’s begin with protection. We protect our user base by requiring all new users to verify their identity including name and age through SingPass as is demonstrated on screen through a new user logging in. This filters our spam bots and potential bad actors from entering the platform. SingPass is a government platform widely used in Singapore, and the most accurate method of identity verification in Singapore. We also protect the platform from spam posting, by requiring a manual review for each posting.
